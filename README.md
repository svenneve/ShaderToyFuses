# ShaderToyFuses
A collection of ShaderToy shaders converted to Fusion fuses.

Most of the shaders are converted as best as possible (though they won't always match, mostly because i was too lazy to use image2d_t instead of FuReadImage)
I'll post an example using image2d_t with the sampler set repeating or mirror repeating.

Unless stated otherwise ShaderToy shaders are licensed using the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (which is a unfortunate)

Examples of what the shaders look like in Fusion using OpenCL:
